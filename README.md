# MonoSolitaire

This project is to create a solitaire game using MonoGame. The goal is to design a "system" that makes adding additional games simple by only needing to define the board layout.

The first targeted game to implement will be FreeCell, but if the system works as expected then all sorts of games should be easy to add.
